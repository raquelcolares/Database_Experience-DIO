My repository shows my projects during the Database Experience bootcamp by Digital Innovation One (DIO). 

On this immersion, I improved on the main concepts of SQL and NoSQL databases, with educational experiences and exclusive mentorships on data modeling, DBMS, EER, architecture, queries, among others.
